The goal of **paletteer** is to be a comprehensive collection of color
palettes in R using a common interface. Think of it as the “caret of
palettes”.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **paletteer** from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("paletteer")
```

If you want the development version instead then install directly from
GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EmilHvitfeldt/paletteer")
```

## Palettes

The palettes are divided into 2 groups; *discrete* and *continuous*. For
discrete palette you have the choice between the *fixed width palettes*
and *dynamic palettes*. Most common of the two are the fixed width
palettes which have a set amount of colors which doesn’t change when the
number of colors requested vary like the following palettes:

on the other hand we have the dynamic palettes where the colors of the
palette depend on the number of colors you need like the `green.pal`
palette from the `cartography` package:

Lastly we have the continuous palettes which provides as many colors as
you need for a smooth transition of color:

This package includes 1085 from 31 different packages and information
about these can be found in the following data.frames:
`palettes_c_names`, `palettes_d_names` and `palettes_dynamic_names`.
Additionally this [github
repo](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes) showcases all
the palettes included in the package and more.

## Examples

All the palettes can be accessed from the 3 functions `paletteer_c()`,
`paletteer_d()` and `paletteer_dynamic()` using the package and palette
arguments.

``` r
paletteer_c(package = "scico", palette = "berlin", n = 10)
#>  [1] "#9EB0FF" "#5AA3DA" "#2D7597" "#194155" "#11181D" "#270C01" "#501802"
#>  [8] "#8A3F2A" "#C37469" "#FFACAC"
paletteer_d("nord", "frost")
#> [1] "#8FBCBB" "#88C0D0" "#81A1C1" "#5E81AC"
paletteer_dynamic("cartography", "green.pal", 5)
#> [1] "#B8D9A9" "#8DBC80" "#5D9D52" "#287A22" "#17692C"
```

All of the functions also support symbol argument such that you don’t
have to put your names in quotes

``` r
paletteer_c(scico, berlin, 10)
#>  [1] "#9EB0FF" "#5AA3DA" "#2D7597" "#194155" "#11181D" "#270C01" "#501802"
#>  [8] "#8A3F2A" "#C37469" "#FFACAC"
paletteer_d(nord, frost)
#> [1] "#8FBCBB" "#88C0D0" "#81A1C1" "#5E81AC"
paletteer_dynamic(cartography, green.pal, 5)
#> [1] "#B8D9A9" "#8DBC80" "#5D9D52" "#287A22" "#17692C"
```

## ggplot2 scales

Lastly the package also includes scales for `ggplot2` using the same
standard interface

``` r
library(ggplot2)
#> Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 3.5.3

ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_paletteer_d(nord, aurora)
```
